## Planning the Trip

A good vacation is more or less predicated on the weather events that will occur on the planned date. As such, the purpose of this Data Analytics Project is to make reasonable predictions on the weather events that will occur for the trip that is planned to occur on the 1st of July, 2017 and end on the 31st of July, 2017. Therefore, a series of queries using the SQLAlchemy and Pandas Python modules were used to study weather patterns that occurred in the previous year of the planned date in order to gauge what could possibly be expected during the trip.
